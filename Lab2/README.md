In this lab project, we develop two programs, one called 'launch' and one called 'tube'. The launch program will use a child process to launch the program that was entered as a command line argument. The tube program will create two children and each children will execute their respective programs that will be inputted through command line arguments.

## Usage

```
./launch /bin/ls

```

## Output Example

```
/bin/ls: $$ = 26843
a.out foo.c
/bin/ls: $? = 0
```
