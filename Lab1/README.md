# Time and Forking Children

![alt text](https://i.redd.it/gcb99vkytij41.jpg "lol")

In this lab project, a command line tool was written that reports PID (Process Identification Information) using the fork() system call to create a child and then using pid() and ppid() to report the appropriate information. The start time and end times are included along with user time and system time for both parent and child.

## Usage

```
make all
./time-4-baby-and-me
```

## Output Example

```
START: 1582918659
PPID: 121, PID: 122
PPID: 6, PID: 121, CPID: 122, RET: 0
USER: 0, SYS: 0
CUSER: 0, CSYS: 1
END: 1582918659
```
